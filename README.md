### Project Specification for Group # 221
Team Name: Javaphiles 
Domain:
Art Museum search engine

### Project's purpose:
The program makes queries using APIs of museums and art galleries based on specifications the user gives it 
(e.g. The artist, whether a piece of art is on view in the museum) in the form of filters or searching for 
specific names, etc. and returns a collection of the art pieces as well as details such as the Artist credited, 
the museum which it currently belongs in, the date of acquisition of this artifact, 
and an image of the art piece(if available). The program also selectively adapts to each of the APIs queried 
since there are features of a museum/gallery API which might help with our query but is not present in every API. \ \
This project was made because it seemed like there were no single search engine that would be able to query museum 
databases specifically other than the search tied to respective museums, and what this program aims to do is to 
query multiple museums for results at the same time.
