## Principles of Universal Design 

Equitable Use - The program runs on Windows 11, MacOS as well as Ubuntu Linux. It is an app made for PC, and the three most prominent types of operating systems are covered.

Flexibility in Use - The filter system provides flexibility in the ways a user of our program can search for artworks. 

Simple and Intuitive Use - Our search engine program is minimalistic, with a text input for the search query as well as a button to perform the query. Almost all popular search engines in the world, so the user should feel that this is intuitive to them as long as they’ve used any other search engine(or even if they haven’t). 

Perceptible information - The information presented from the return objects of the search queries is presented as images which are very perceptible, and then you can click on the images to view more detailed information. 

Tolerance for Error - If the user made an unintended query or they want to search using a different filter, they can use the clear button to start over. 

Low Physical Effort - This does not apply to us - The program is not particularly physically demanding, since it is operated purely by typing and clicking. 

Size and Space for Approach and Use - Our program is <2MB, which is relatively small, any user should be able to get them on their platform. 

## "If we were to sell or license your program to customers..?"
If we were to sell or license our program, our target demographic would be art enthusiasts or those who are inclined to visit museums. What they would get out of our program is the ability to look up artworks in multiple museums and check their status before, or without the need of visiting the actual museums. Most primarily, they would not need to search multiple times in the museums’ respective repositories. 
## Demographics which would be less inclined to use our program
The program would not be used by mobile phone users as it is not built for any mobile operating systems. The program would be less likely to be used by those with sight impairments, because the program is primarily visual-driven with no sound cues or text-to-speech functionality. The program would also be less likely to be used by those who are more familiar and more inclined to work with command-line interfaces instead of graphical interfaces.
